# Enigma

## Functionality: 3 
- Enigma encrypt and decrypt methods are successfully implemented. The CLI properly function.  

## OOP: 3
- Enigma is properly broken up into smaller logical components that are encapsulated in other classes. Failed to use a module and there are two methods longer than 10 lines.

## Ruby Conventions and Mechanics: 3
- The project syntax, spacing, and indentation are consistent across the project. Naming convention, variables, and file names follow convention. Also implemented an alphabet hash to apply shifts.

## TDD: 3
- Did not use any mocks or stubs on this project. Every method is tested, and there is one line that is not being hit on SimpleCov, thus generating 99.5% coverage.
